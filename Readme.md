# Microboxlabs Auth Manager

The `microboxlabs_auth_manager` is a project dedicated to providing robust authentication management solutions across different languages and frameworks. This repository houses two main implementations of the authentication manager: one written in Elixir and the other in Python3.

## Structure

- **Elixir Implementation**: Located under the `elixir/microboxlabs_auth_manager` directory. This version harnesses the power and concurrency capabilities of the Elixir language, ensuring efficient authentication processes.
  
- **Python3 Implementation**: Located under the `python3/microboxlabs-auth-manager` directory. Designed with Python's simplicity and vast libraries, this version provides a straightforward approach to authentication management.
